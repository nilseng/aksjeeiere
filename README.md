# About this project

An application for searching for companies and shareholders in the Norwegian stock market. Data is presented in a graph where the nodes represent the actors in the stock market and the edges represent relationships between them. The graph is directed with each edge going from the investor to the investment.

Here's an example with one of the largest publicly traded companies in Norway, Telenor ASA:

And another one with my own private company:
